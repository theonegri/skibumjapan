        <h2>How to shower</h2>
        <p>
          Ski regions in Japan have a large number of onsens, which are traditional public bathhouses built around hot
          spring water.
          Even if your camper van has a shower, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to use it in winter—water pipes in Japanese
          camper vans are rarely insulated.
          Because of that, onsens are generally the best option for a hot shower after a ski day.
          <br />
          The farther you go from major resorts, the cheaper onsens tend to be. They are often cash-only.
          If you’ve never been to one before, check out the onsen mini-guide to understand how they work and what to
          expect.
        </p>

      <section class="section" id="laundry">
        <h2>Laundry</h2>
        <p>
          Major cities and ski resort areas in Japan often have coin laundromats and they’re generally easy to use even
          if you don’t speak Japanese. The machines are straightforward, one nice difference is that you don’t need to
          bring your own detergent since it’s usually automatically dispensed by the washing machine.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section" id="trash-disposal">
        <h2>Trash &amp; disposal</h2>
        <p>
          Public trash cans are rare in Japan. Most people carry their trash home and dispose of it there, which is
          harder to do when traveling by camper van.
          <br />
          Your best bet is to dispose of trash gradually at convenience stores. Be mindful to sort trash correctly,
          follow the labels on the bins,
          and never overfill them.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section" id="cash">
        <h2>Cash is king</h2>
        <p>
          Cash is still widely used in Japan, especially outside major cities. Onsens, vending machines, and parking
          machines are often cash-only,
          and the farther you get from Tokyo, the more cash-only restaurants you’ll encounter.
          <br />
          It’s a good idea to always carry some cash with you. Most convenience stores have ATMs that work with foreign
          cards.
