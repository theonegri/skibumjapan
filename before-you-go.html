        <h2>Camper culture in Japan</h2>
        <p>
          A lot of Japanese skiers sleep in their cars on winter weekends, so doing the same never feels out of place.
          Between the 24-hour restrooms, vending machines, parking areas, and the fact that many resorts allow overnight
          stays,
          traveling by camper van just works. And even when a resort doesn’t offer overnight parking, there’s almost
          always a konbini
          close by where people quietly sleep in their cars without it being a big deal.
        </p>

      <section class="section" id="renting">
        <h2>Where and what to rent</h2>
        <p>
          Campers can be rented in major cities near ski regions, like Tokyo, Nagano and Sapporo. In winter, the van
          must have snow tires
          (checkpoints are common during storms) and I also recommend to get a 4WD van. A diesel heater in the van is
          required, as
          temperatures drop well below freezing at night (I've seen -15°C in Hokkaido!).
        </p>

      <section class="section" id="driving">
        <h2>Driving in Japan</h2>
        <p>
          Foreign visitors need an International Driving Permit to rent and drive in Japan and rental companies will not
          release a vehicle
          without one (these permits must be renewed yearly!). International Driving Permit do not replace your driver
          license. You must carry both of them(as well as your passport). I also recommend to get an ETC card (often
          provided by the rental company),
          as it allows seamless use of Japan’s toll roads and makes driving much easier. Japan drives on the left side
          of the road,
          which can feel intimidating at first, you'll get used to it.
        </p>

      <section class="section" id="camping-etiquette">
        <h2>Camping etiquette</h2>
        <p>
          Overnight parking in Japan follows clear, unwritten rules. Parking lots are not campsites: no chairs or tables
          outside, no cooking
          in parking lots, no music, lights kept off once it gets late, and avoid idling whenever possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trash is always your responsibility, carry it with you until you can dispose of it properly (Best way to do it
          is at the konbinis)
          and remember that parking lots are workspaces first, used for snow removal, staff access, and morning setup.
          When these expectations
          are respected, overnight parking fits naturally into how resorts already operate.
